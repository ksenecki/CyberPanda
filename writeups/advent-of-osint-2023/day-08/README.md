## Task

![Stars](assets/photo8.jpg)  

This representation was refused and the " ad hoc committee " president in charge of this file mentions it in the pages 18 to 20 of his book.
He mentions a pun, what is the corresponding Latin name?  
(Example: lapis pretiosus)  

## Solution

1. We can start google image search to find there may be something with either [Alaskian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Alaska) or [European Union](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Old_eu_flag_6.png) flag.
2. Then you quickly get to either [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillologycirclejerk/comments/pj3mfe/flag_of_alaska_but_ursa_major_is_actually_complete/) or [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapeau_europ%C3%A9en). I couldn't find anything on Wikipedia until I tried French one. You have to keep in mind that this challenge was prepared for French guys.
3. Now you can even look `ctrl+f` for an `ad hoc committee` on the page.
4. Once you look for Committee [chairman](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bichet) you can find some of his books including the one about the [European Flag](https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/the_european_flag_by_robert_bichet_1985-en-87d0bdab-4bf1-495a-8209-2de3a024d030.html).  

There is another way you can find the answer and this is the way I did it first. Much faster if you don't speak French.
1. You can search for an "Alcor" star mentioned in the title to look for more details.  
2. https://cylect.io/ gets in handy again. Mizar and Alcor are notable for being a naked-eye double star visible in the handle of the Big Dipper (or Plough) asterism. Mizar itself is a quadruple system, and Alcor is a binary, making the pair together a sextuple system. This system was the first known binary star system, discovered by Italian astronomer [Giovanni Battista Riccioli](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Riccioli) in 1650.  
3. The `Almagestum Novum` describes the Mizar-Alcor constellation and compares it to `Great Bear`.
