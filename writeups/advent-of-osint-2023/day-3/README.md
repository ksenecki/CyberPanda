## Task

![Message](assets\photo3.png)

My friend Zoé Kastox has trouble with technology. The proof is, she just sent me a text, but who does that nowadays? Luckily, she isn't as bad with social media...
1. Who sent the first commercial text message in history (first name then surname)?
2. Which costume does Zoé like?
(Example: john caprio kingkong)

## Solution

1. Ask [cylect.io](https://cylect.io/)
   > Who sent the first commercial text message in history?

3. Find [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zoeredleaf/)
