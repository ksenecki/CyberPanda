This representation was refused and the " ad hoc committee " president in charge of this file mentions it in the pages 18 to 20 of his book.
He mentions a pun, what is the corresponding Latin name?  
(Example: lapis pretiosus)  

## Solution

1. This is a North Star. We can use "Alcor" star mentioned in the title to look for more details.  
2. https://cylect.io/ gets in handy again. Mizar and Alcor are notable for being a naked-eye double star visible in the handle of the Big Dipper (or Plough) asterism. Mizar itself is a quadruple system, and Alcor is a binary, making the pair together a sextuple system. This system was the first known binary star system, discovered by Italian astronomer [Giovanni Battista Riccioli](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Riccioli) in 1650.  
3. The `Almagestum Novum` describes the Mizar-Alcor constellation and compares it to `Great Bear`.
